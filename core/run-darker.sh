# Git pre-commit hook to check staged Python files for formatting issues with
# darker.
#
# INSTALLING: Copy this script into `.git/hooks/pre-commit`, and mark it as
# executable.
#
# This requires that darker is installed and runnable in the environment running
# the pre-commit hook.
#
# When running, this first checks for unstaged changes to staged files, and if
# there are any, it will exit with an error. Files with unstaged changes will be
# printed.
#
# If all staged files have no unstaged changes, it will run darker against them,
# leaving the formatting changes unstaged. Changed files will be printed.
#
# BUGS: This does not leave staged changes alone when used with the -a flag to
# git commit, due to the fact that git stages ALL unstaged files when that flag
# is used.

# Find all staged Python files, and exit early if there aren't any.
