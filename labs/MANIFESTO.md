* We keep the Startup Spirit up!
  - We value creativity
  - We promote a flat hierarchy
  - We communicate openly

* We value practical products over plain research
  - We are not a university
  - We are not a boring company

* We are NOT afraid of highly ambitious ideas!
  - *“An idea that is not dangerous is unworthy of being called an idea at all.”* – Oscar Wilde
