# How to start any web3 project?

***Fact:*** Seeing people actually want your product heavily increases your passion for your project. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to build the community around any web3 product and keeping the hype high:

1. Choose a name and create a logo
   * You'll need a brand/logo for almost every other step that you need take. Choose the name and logo as soon as possible, even before knowing what your product is going to become all about. Don't be obsessed with them since you can change them later. You can use AI image generators for creating your logo!
2. Build a very simple website
   * A website, even a very simple one, gives a significant credit to your project and is an important indicator that you're serious with your work. The website can be as simple as a static landing-page explaining your idea, hosted on GitHub Pages.
3. Create a Twitter account
   * Twitter is where all the good stuff happens! Given the name and logo, you can quickly setup a profile for your project. Twitter is where you can express your presence to the community and find your first users, so take care of it well! Don't forget to put a bio, a profile header and your website.
4. Create a Discord server
   * Discord is where people could communicate with you and each other. Discord is where you can find out how people feel about your project.
5. Explain your project in a few tweets
   * You want your first twitter visitors to know what your project is all about.
6. Interact with other web3 users
   * Start by following them randomly. Following/Liking/Mentioning/Retweeting other users will help them to notice you. Pick users with a few followers (<5k) and avoid super-famous accounts or inactive ones.
7. Express the possibility of launching a token
   * There are thousands of users waiting to hunt new tokens and airdrops. Tweeting something like: "Drop your SOL address!" will suddenly make thousands of people to notice you and interact with your tweet/profile. Don't forget to also invite your twitter users into the discord server while tweeting these kind of tweets which will give you high tractions!
8. Congrats! You now have a great community waiting for your product!
   * Build and ship!
